        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the BEST pumpkin cake I’ve ever had and I know you’ll feel the same way! It’s supremely moist, soft, rich, and spiced with pumpkin spice flavor.</p>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>
1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice*</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) canola or vegetable oil*</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree*</li>

       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (177Â°C) and grease a 9Ã—13 inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk the oil, eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, pumpkin, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a mixer or whisk until completely combined. Batter will be thick.</li>
        <li>Spread batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 30-36 minutes. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If you find the top or edges of the cake is/are browning too quickly in the oven, loosely cover it with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and set the entire pan on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely. After about 45 minutes, I usually place the cake in the refrigerator to speed things up.</li>
        <li>Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add 3 cups confectionersâ€™ sugar, vanilla, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the extra 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar (I add it). Spread the frosting on the cooled cake. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. This helps sets the frosting and makes cutting easier.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.</li>
       </ol>
